    <h3 >E-waste recycling is the process of extracting valuable materials after shredding the e-waste into tiny pieces that could be reused in a new electronic appliance. However, a number of current challenges are preventing the electronic recycling industry from scaling up. To celebrate International E-Waste Day 2023, we explore how e-waste recycling is done and why we should focus on scaling it up</h3>

    <h2>Current Status On Global E-Waste Generation:</h2>
    <h3>The rate of generation of e-waste at the global level has increased substantively in recent years. While previous estimates suggested an annual growth rate of 3–4 % (ASSOCHAM-NEC, 2018; Balde et al., 2017, 2015), by the year 2019, the growth rate of global e-waste generation has increased to around 6% (Forti et al., 2020). The global e-waste generated in 2019 is estimated comprising 17.4 Mt small equipment, 13.1 Mt large equipment, 10.8 Mt temperature exchange equipment, 6.7 Mt screens and</h3>

    <h2>Exposure to pollutants associated with <b>E-waste</b>:</h2>
    <h3>  E-waste recycling without appropriate measures to limit environmental pollution can add a variety of organic and inorganic pollutants such as heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) into the ecosystem which can adversely affect human health. This section discusses exposure</h3>
    <h2>E-waste recycling methods:</h2>
    <h3>In the modern era of rapid technological advances, a large amount of e-waste has been accumulated from the increased production of EEE that turn to e-waste upon the end of its useful life. Effective strategies are required both at production stage and after-use for environmentally sound management of the e-waste. Recycling is a valuable tool to control the rising heaps of e-waste; however, sub-optimal practices of recycling are contributing to increase in the levels of toxic pollutants in the world.</h3>

    <h2>Challenges and Opportunities associated with E-waste</h2>
    <h3>Metals, plastics, glass, and rare earth elements present in e-waste are valuable secondary resources. The richness of e-waste for valuable elements can be understood by estimates that suggest a typical cathode-ray tube TV carry approximately 450 g Cu, 227 g Al and 5.6 g Au (Zeng et al., 2018). Similarly, a metric ton of waste personal computers may generate more gold than that recovered from 17 metric ton of gold ore (Bleiwas and Kelly, 2001). The conventional e-waste recycling activities have,</h3>
    <h2>Strategies for effective and environmentally safe E-waste management:</h2>
    <h3>The amount of e-waste generated around the global is continuously growing at substantial rate. While on the one hand, improper e-waste recycling without adequate safeguards can potentially threaten human health, on the other, it also provides livelihoods to countless poor workers, particularly in the developing countries. Hence, aiming to manage e-waste menace by just implementing legislative laws and empanelling channels for its organised recycling may not be sufficient. Collaborative efforts</h3>

    <h2>Benefits of Recycling E-waste</h2>
    <h2>Save Landfill Space.</h2>

        <h3></h3>Electronic waste is being thrown into landfills at an increasing rate each year. This problem is prevalent not only in the USA but is quickly spreading around the world. Throwing e-waste into landfills creates many environmental issues.
        For example, the metals used in electronic gadgets such as iron, aluminium, and gold erode and release harmful toxins into the soil. Similarly, the plastic in these gadgets can release poisonous toxins into the soil. The toxins of this polluted soil kill all kinds of plants and microorganisms living on that land. It destroys their ecosystems and worsens the health of the environment. In the worst-case scenario, the poison spreads in the soil and eventually seeps into water sources.
        E-Waste When e-waste is recycled, it does not land in a landfill.Instead, the components of electronics are separated and sorted. So they can help us in the long run. With a circular economy, you can expect your e-waste becomes a second source of energy and new products.  Non-recyclable components are disposed of properly, so their harmful impact on the environment is reduced. At the same time, recoverable e-waste helps create new products. Keeping e-waste out of landfills reduces the space a landfill occupies. </h3>
        <h2>2.       Save Natural Resources.</h2>
        <h3>As per studies, 98% of components in an electronic device are recyclable. Metals extracted through mining require much difficulty and effort. Apart from mining, the cost to refine metals and transform them into a usable form is also high. Through the extraction and reuse of metal from old electronic gadgets, the need to manufacture and refine raw metals decreases.
        Wires and other components of electronic devices made of aluminium and copper can be reused multiple times. Reutilizing them in other electronic devices means little to no material goes to waste. Hence, the need to mine, extract and manufacture more natural resources reduces. So does e-waste.  Electronics have many components of glass. For example, the screen of any PC, laptop, television, smartphone, or any other electronics is of high-quality glass. Manufacturing glass from scratch requires a lot of energy. Manufacturers reuse glass from recycling older electronics, so it does not go to waste. This also saves time and money in manufacturing new glass.</h3>
        
        <h2>3.       Increase in Employment Opportunities!</h2>
        
        <h3>Only experts can deal with e-waste properly. Distinguishing between reusable and non-reusable materials is a task that requires a sharp eye and a lot of product knowledge. There are a lot of jobs in the field of recycling. Thanks to the recycling industry. Responsible people working in recycling help us reduce the amount of e-waste. Increased education about electronics recycling means more people will recycle, and more job opportunities will be available.
        By recycling e-waste, several people get a job. More jobs mean financial stability for our communities. The overall economy of the United States gets a boost. Eventually, it results in the prosperity of the whole nation. 
        E-Waste</h3>
        <h2>4.       Increases Affordability.</h2>
        <h3>In many cases, people want to get rid of an electronic device not because it has stopped working, but because they want to buy one with the latest technology. If they give their old gadgets to charity or sell them in a second-hand shop, other people who cannot afford to buy new electronic devices can easily buy them. Always remember, you may not need an electronics, but it could be of the utmost importance to someone else!
        Many schools in America accept spent electronic devices and utilize them. Hundreds of charities exist throughout the States that take e-waste from people and deliver them to different parts of the world for reuse. If donation is something you do not prefer…</h3>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <h3>In this age of information and communication technology, electronic and electrical devices have become almost indispensable. Owing to the fast-developing nature of the technology, many such devices become obsolete within a few years of their production. These factors, along with the growth in demand due to increasing purchasing power of people across the world, lead to the generation of enormous quantities of e-waste. While e-waste recycling is being carried out in many parts of the world.</h3>
